mongoose-tsgen
==============

<strong>UNDER DEVELOPMENT: This CLI will be released as an npm module once it has been solidified and cleaned up. The current method to generate typings works well but could use a bit of work still. Any help is appreciated ðŸ”¥</strong>

A Typescript interface generator for Mongoose that works out of the box.

No, you don't need to rewrite your entire schemas, nor do you need to limit which Mongoose features you use (really!). This CLI works by importing your schema definitions, parsing the structure and generating an index.d.ts file.

Features:
- Automatically creates two interfaces for each exported Schema, `I{model_name}` and `I{model_name}Model` (ie IUser and IUserModel). The first can be imported across your project and used as a document type and will contain your schema properties, virtual properties and methods. The second will be used to initialize your Mongoose model and will contain any static functions.
- Any subdocuments will also be given their own interface which will be referenced in its parent interface. These can also be referenced in your project the same way as the parent interfaces. Interface names will be camel-cased with respect to the flattened property name (ie say we have an subdocument array of `friends` on `IUser`, where each subdoc contains various properties related to the friend. An interface named `IUserFriend` will be created with the document properties, and `IUser` will reference it like so: `friends: mongoose.Types.DocumentArray<IUserFriend>`).
- A section for custom interfaces and types is provided at the bottom of `index.d.ts`. This will remain untouched when re-generating the interfaces unless the `--fresh` flag is provided.

Coming Soon (most of the following features are already supported but use looser typing than likely desired):
- Methods and statics parameter types. Currently these are typed as `Function`.
- Support for `Model.Create`. Currently `new Model` must be used.
- Support for setting subdocument properties without casting to any. When setting a subdocument array, Typescript will yell at you if you try and set them directly (ie `user.friends = [{ uid, name }]`) as it expects the array to contain additional subdocument properties. For now, this can be achieved by writing `user.friends = [{ uid, name }] as any`.

Would love any help with the listed features above.

Once you've generated your index.d.ts file, all you need to do is add the following types to your schema definitions:

* Before:

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const UserSchema = new Schema(...);

export const User = mongoose.model("User", UserSchema);
export default User;
```

* After:

```javascript
import mongoose, { IUser, IUserModel } from "mongoose";

const UserSchema = new Schema(...);

export const User: IUserModel = mongoose.model<IUser, IUserModel>("User", UserSchema);
export default User;
```
